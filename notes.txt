data_cleaning
data
Data I/O
<p>Like Stata's ".dta" format, R has its own native ".rds" binary file storage type. (See also the <a href = "http://www.fstpackage.org/" class="text-[#4c807b] font-semibold underline">fst</a> package.) However, we generally recommend that users avoid native—especially proprietary—data types since they hamper interoperability and reproducibility. We'll hence concentrate on common open-source file types below. We'll make an exception for .dta given our target audience, but we still recommend avoiding it if possible.</p>

data_cleaning
subset
Subset
<p>While it takes some doing in Stata to work with multiple data sets at once (and most people do not use Stata this way, and it doesn't work in old versions), using multiple datasets at once is standard in R, and <span class="font-semibold">subsetting operations won't overwrite your original dataset</span>. That means you don't need to wrap everything in preserve/restore. However, it also means that you'll need to (re)assign your subsetted data if you want to use it again later. E.g. `dat1 = dat[origin=='LGA']`.</p>

data_cleaning
modify
Modify
<p>In R, any missing (i.e. "NA") values will propagate during aggregating functions. If you have NA values in your real-life dataset — we don't in this example dataset — you probably want to add "na.rm=TRUE" to remove these on the fly. E.g. "mean(var1, na.rm=TRUE)" or "lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm=TRUE)".</p>

data_cleaning
collapse
Collapse
<p>While it takes some doing in Stata to work with multiple data sets at once (and most people do not use Stata this way, and it doesn't work in old versions), using multiple datasets at once is standard in R. That means you don't need to wrap everything in preserve/restore. However, it also means that you'll need to (re)assign your collapsed data if you want to use it again later. E.g. "dat1 = dat[, mean(var1)]". Also remember our earlier note about aggregating functions on columns that have missing values: Use "na.rm=TRUE" to remove these on the fly. E.g. "dat[, mean(var1, na.rm=TRUE)]".</p>

regression
std_errors
Standard errors
<p>While you can specify standard errors inside the original <span class="font-semibold">fixest</span> model call (just like Stata), a unique feature of R is that you can adjust errors for an exisiting model <i>on the fly</i>. This has <span class="text-[#4c807b] underline"><a href = "https://grantmcdermott.com/better-way-adjust-SEs">several benefits</a></span>, including being much more efficient since you don't have to re-estimate your whole model. We'll try to highlight examples of both approaches below.</p>

regression
panel
Panel data
<p>Note you don't need to specify panel.vars if you make your data a panel dataset before running the regression using the `panel` function. For example, you can use `panel(dat, ~ id + var)`.

ggplot
ggplot2: Beautiful and customizable plots
<p><a href = "https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/" class="text-[#4c807b] font-semibold underline">ggplot2</a> is widely considered one of the preeminent plotting libraries available in any language. It provides an intuitive syntax that applies in the same way across many, many different kinds of vizualisations, and with a deep level of available customization. Plus, endless additional plugins to do what you want, including easy interactivity, animation, maps, etc. We thought about giving <span class="font-semibold">ggplot2</span> its own dedicated page like <span class="font-semibold">data.table</span> and <span class="font-semibold">fixest</span>. But instead we'll point you to the <span class="text-[#4c807b] font-semibold underline"><a  href = "https://lost-stats.github.io/Presentation/Figures/Figures.html">Figures</a></span> section of the Library of Statistical Techniques, which already shows how to do many different graphing tasks in both Stata and <span class="font-semibold">ggplot2</span>. For a more in-depth overview you can always consult the excellent <a href = "https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/" class="text-[#4c807b] font-semibold underline">package documentation</a>, or a book like Kieran Healy's <span class="text-[#4c807b] font-semibold underline italic"><a href = "https://socviz.co/">Data Visualization</a></span>.

tidyverse
tidyverse
<p>The <a href = "https://www.tidyverse.org" class="text-[#4c807b] font-semibold underline">tidyverse</a> provides an extremely popular framework for data science tasks in R. This meta-package is actually a collection of smaller packages that are all designed to work together, based on a shared philosophy and syntax. We've already covered <span class="font-semibold">ggplot2</span> above, but there are plenty more. These include <span class="font-semibold">dplyr</span> and <span class="font-semibold">tidyr</span>, which offer an alternative syntax and approach to data wrangling tasks.  While we personally recommend <span class="font-semibold">data.table</span>, these <span class="font-semibold">tidyverse</span> packages have many ardent fans too. You may find that you prefer their modular design and verbal syntax. But don't feel bound either way: it's totally fine to combine them. Some other tidyverse packages worth knowing about include <span class="font-semibold">purrr</span>, which contains a suite of functions for automating and looping your work, <span class="font-semibold">lubridate</span> which makes working with date-based data easy, and <span class="font-semibold">stringr</span> which offers functions with straightforward syntax for working with string variables.</p>

collapse
collapse: Extra convenience functions and super fast aggregations
<p>Sure, we've gone on and on about how fast <span class="font-semibold">data.table</span> is compared to just about everything else. But there is another R package that can boast even faster computation times for certain grouped calculations and transformations, and that's <a href = "https://sebkrantz.github.io/collapse/index.html" class="text-[#4c807b] font-semibold underline">collapse</a>. The <span class="font-semibold">collapse</span> package doesn't try to do everything that <span class="font-semibold">data.table</span> does. But the two <a href="https://sebkrantz.github.io/collapse/articles/collapse_and_data.table.html">play very well together</a> and the former offers some convenience functions like `descr` and `collap`, which essentially mimic the equivalent functions in Stata and might be particularly appealing to readers of this guide. (P.S. If you'd like to load <span class="font-semibold">data.table</span> and <span class="font-semibold">collapse</span> at the same time, plus some other high-performance packages, check out the <a href = "https://sebkrantz.github.io/fastverse/index.html" class="text-[#4c807b] font-semibold underline">fastverse</a>.)</p>

sandwich
sandwich: More standard error adjustments
<p>The <span class="font-semibold">fixest</span> package comes with plenty of shortcuts for accessing standard-error adjustments like HC1 heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors, Newey-West, Driscoll-Kraay, or clustered standard errors. But there are, of course, many more than that. A host of additional options are covered by the <a href = "https://sandwich.r-forge.r-project.org/articles/sandwich.html" class="text-[#4c807b] font-semibold underline">sandwich</a> package, which comes with a long list of functions like <span class="font-semibold">vcovBS()</span> for bootstrapped standard errors, or <span class="font-semibold">vcovHC()</span> for HC1-5. These can slot right into <span class="font-semibold">fixest</span> estimates, too. You shouldn't be using those `, robust` errors for smaller samples anyway... but you <a href = "http://datacolada.org/99" class="text-[#4c807b] underline">knew that</a>, right?</p>

misc
modelsummary
modelsummary: Summary tables, regression tables, and more
<p>The <span class="font-semibold">fixest</span> package already has the <span class="font-semibold">etable()</span> function for generating regression tables. However, it is only really intended to work with models from the same package. So we also recommend checking out the fantastic <a href = "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/" class="text-[#4c807b] font-semibold underline">modelsummary</a> package. It works with all sorts of model objects, including those not from <span class="font-semibold">fixest</span>, is incredibly customizable, and outputs to a bunch of different formats (PDF, HTML, DOCX, etc). Similarly, <span class="font-semibold">modelsummary</span> has a wealth of options for producing publication-ready summary tables. Oh, and it produces coefficient plots too. Check out the <a href = "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/" class="text-[#4c807b] font-semibold underline">package website</a> for more.</p>

lme4
lme4: Random effects and mixed models
<p><span class="font-semibold">fixest</span> can do a lot, but it can't do everything. This site isn't even going to attempt to go into how to translate every single model into R. But we'll quick highlight random-effects and mixed models. The <a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html" class="text-[#4c807b] font-semibold underline">lme4</a> package and its <span class="font-semibold">lmer()</span> function covers not just random-intercept models but also hierarchical models where slope coefficients follow random distributions. (<span class="font-semibold">Aside:</span> If you prefer Bayesian models for this kind of thing, check out the <a href = "https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/" class="text-[#4c807b] font-semibold underline">brms</a> package.)</p>

misc
marginaleffects
marginaleffects: Marginal effects, constrasts, etc.
<p>The Stata <span class="font-semibold">margins</span> command is great. To replicate it in R, we recommend the <a href = "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/" class="text-[#4c807b] font-semibold underline">marginaleffects</a> package. Individual marginal effects or average marginal effects for nonlinear models, or models with interactions or transformations, etc. It's also very fast.</p>

misc
multcomp
multcomp and nlWaldTest: Joint coefficient tests
<p>Stata provides a number of inbuilt commands for (potentially complex) postestimation coefficient tests like <span class="font-semibold">testparm</span>, <span class="font-semibold">lincom</span>, and <span class="font-semibold">nlcom</span>. We've already seen that <span class="font-semibold">fixest</span> covers the <span class="font-semibold">testparm</span> equivalent with its <span class="font-semibold">wald()</span> function. But what about combinations of coefficients? The <a href = "http://multcomp.r-forge.r-project.org/" class="text-[#4c807b] font-semibold underline">multcomp</a> package handles a variety of linear tests and combinations, while <a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nlWaldTest/index.html" class="text-[#4c807b] font-semibold underline">nlWaldTest</a> has you covered for nonlinear combinations.</p>

sf
sf: Geospatial operations
<p>R has outstanding support for geospatial computation and mapping. There are a variety of packages to choose from here, depending on what you want (e.g. interactive maps, high-dimensional data cubes, etc.) But the workhorse geospatial tool for most R users is the incredibly versatile <a href = "https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/" class="text-[#4c807b] font-semibold underline">sf</a> package. We'll only provide a simple mapping example below. The <span class="font-semibold">sf</span> <a href = "https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/" class="text-[#4c807b] underline">website</a> has several in-depth tutorials, and we also recommend the <span class="text-[#4c807b] font-semibold underline italic"><a href = "https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/">Geocomputation with R</a></span> book by Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad, and Jannes Muenchow.</p>
