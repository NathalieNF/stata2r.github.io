<p>The goal of this site is to provide a simple 'on-ramp' to R for Stata users.
There are two main pages (✌️📄) on this site:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data wrangling (🗄🧹) with <RouterLink to="/data.table/"><strong>data.table</strong></RouterLink></li>
<li>Regression analysis (💻📈) with <RouterLink to="/fixest/"><strong>fixest</strong></RouterLink></li>
</ol>
<p>There are <RouterLink to="/extras/"><strong>other great packages</strong></RouterLink>
that work well and are easy to use, but <strong>data.table</strong> and <strong>fixest</strong> are
blazingly fast (🏃🏻💨) and highly powerful (💪🏻😎).</p>
<p>Plus, they are flexible (👌✨) and can help you avoid R's &quot;package overload&quot;.
Depending on what you do in Stata, you might even be able to cut back, going
from three packages—<strong>reghdfe</strong>, <strong>estout</strong> and <strong>gtools</strong>—to just two.</p>
