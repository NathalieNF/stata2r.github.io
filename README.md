## stata2R

This is the GitHub repository for the [stata2R](https://stata2r.github.io/) website.

This website is a short guide intended to help those most familiar with Stata who would like to work with R. Specifically, it translates common Stata commands concerning data cleaning or regression analysis into R code using the packages **data.table** (for data cleaning) and **fixest** (for regression analysis).

There's certainly plenty of R outside the world of those two packages, but this is a good place to start, and for a lot of Stata users this might cover most of what you usually do anyway.

Check out the website! If you have any comments, please leave an Issue on the [Issues tab](https://github.com/stata2r/stata2r.github.io/issues).
